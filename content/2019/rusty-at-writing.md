I wrote a lot of words this afternoon, and now I read them, and
they don't make any sense.

It's as if I had forgotten for a moment that my primary audience
for any of the writing that I've ever done successfully is for the
future me (who will have forgotten what I have learned), and not
for any other real or imagined audience.

I'm just rusty at blogging, I suppose the only thing that will fix
that is practice. It is a bit discouraging to have spent that much
time on it.
